## Description
The project started as [Themed Horror Game Jam #17](https://itch.io/jam/themed-horror-game-jam-17) entry and a learning experience as the first UE game for vailhou. Left unfinished by the deadline, we wanted to make the game a complete experience.

The game aims for an extremely immersive and atmospheric experience in the spirit of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Developing physics based puzzles where the player has to use common sense helps to achieve that goal.

How the game has been made:
- The visuals of the game have been built using free 3D assets and original 2D art.
- The mechanics of the game have been programmed entirely with UE5 blueprints. Using C++ is a considerable option in the future.
- The sound design of the game has been built by using free assets, Metasounds and original music.

## How to Install and Run the Project
- Open the .uproject file located in the root in github, and see the number after "EngineAssociation" to find out the current engine version. Download the corresponding engine version using Epic Games Launcher.

## How to Use the Project
